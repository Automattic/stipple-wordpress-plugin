## Description

Stipple is the fastest way to label and share the content of photos on your site or blog. Labeling your pictures is easy, just briefly describe the people, places or things in your photos. When readers mouse-over your images, they can discover information from your labels.

## Installation

1. If you have added Stipple previously directly to your Wordpress templates, first remove what was added for that installation.
1. [Sign-up](https://stippleit.com/signup) for a Stipple account, or [login](https://stippleit.com/login) if you already have one, and add a site within your account for your Wordpress blog. Make sure your blog's URL is added to the site. Refer to Screnshot #1 for more information.
1. Upload the `stipple` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
1. In the plugin settings, add your site id from the site you created in Step 2. You can find the site id on your dashboard at the Stipple website. See Screenshot #2 for more information.
1. For advanced use, you can use a custom `STIPPLE.load` call, though this isn't required.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### Does Stipple work on pictures within a Flash slideshow?

Unfortunately, no. Due to the nature of the Flash platform, Stipple will not work on images shown within a flash slideshow or image gallery. Stipple can still be used on other pictures on the same page, though.
